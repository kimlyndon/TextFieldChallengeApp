# TextFieldChallenge
## UIKit Fundamentals Lesson 3
### Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree


Build an app that has three text fields with distinct properties:
* One text field is to input a zip code with no more than 5 characters. Keyboard needs to be numerical.
* One text field is for a cash amount. The numbers need to enter screen from right to left with decimal and dollar sign in
  place.
* One text field is to generate a random color as the user types and count the number of characters in the string. It needs 
  to be enabled by a switch. User should not be able to type in this field if the switch is in the off position. 
  
 Use TextFieldDelegate Methods.
